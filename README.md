# GroupChat
This is a Group Chat Application made in Java. This was made to look similar to Discord Mobile. 
This project was made using Mulitthreading and Java Server Sockets. 
To run this project simply run Server, then run each "User" class separately. 
This chat does not save your messages after the server is closed down.
